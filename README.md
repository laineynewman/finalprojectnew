# finalprojectnew

This is my final project for Gov 1005 in the spring of 2020. My project explores the relationship between union density in states over time and Democratic vote share. I analyze this relationship on three levels: the national, regional, and state level.

On my Shiny App, you can use the interactive features to explore my data analysis on the regional and state levels. My national data appears as static models. On the national level, I did not find any statistically significant relationship.
